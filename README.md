# beev vkr

Monorepo scaffold for the project. Currently contains the backend (Go). A frontend (e.g., React) will be added later under `frontend/`.

## Structure

- `backend/` — Go backend (HTTP API, health checks, Postgres, JWT, etc.)
- `frontend/` — will be added later

## Backend (Go)

See `backend/README.md` for details on running the backend.

## Git

This repository is intended to be the single source for both backend and frontend. Common ignores for macOS, Go, Node, and IDEs are configured in the root `.gitignore`.
